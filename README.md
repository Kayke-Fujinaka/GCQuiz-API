<h1 align="center">❓ GCQuiz</h1>

> 🔎 GCQuiz is a Quiz app with three different game options.

## :page_facing_up: Explanation

The project was carried out using the framework [NestJS]([https://nextjs.org](https://nestjs.com/)) integrating with the [Interface](https://github.com/Kayke-Fujinaka/GCQuiz-Front), which helped with authentication, registration, login and data integration. It was created in partnership with my Academy team at the GCB Group.

🎲 **How ​​the Project Works**

The user must register and log in to the application to access the games. The application features three quizzes separated by themes: Finance, Technology and Curiosities. Each game has 10 questions. At the end of a quiz, the user's profile is updated with information on correct answers, errors and questions answered in total, in real time.
